1. A plot of electrical measurements or calculations, often of apparent resistivity or induced polarization as a function of position and electrode separation (which is nonlinearly related to the depth of investigation

A pseudosection indicates how the parameter varies with location and depth, but it can only be converted into a 2D model by inversion. Also called a quasi-section or pseudodepth section

For the dipole-dipole electrode configuration, the data are plotted (Figure P-17) beneath the midpoint between the dipoles at a depth of half the distance between the dipole centers.
